Write a program that takes an incoming binary message as input and displays it as a unary message.

Rules:
- the input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
- the encoded output message consists of blocks of 0
- a block is separated from another block by a space
- two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):
- first block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0
- second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series

For example with a message which consists of only one character: Capital C. C in binary is represented as 1000011, so converting it gives:

0 0 (the first 0 indicates it is one, the second indicates how many times the 1 repeats it self. In this case, a single time)
00 0000 (00's indicates it is a zero, the four 0's indicate there are four of them, until the next 1)
0 00 (the third consists of two 1)
So C is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 00

â€¦hopefully that makes sense

Test Cases:
Q: The character C
A: 0 0 00 0000 0 00

Q: CC
A: 0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00

Q: %
A: 00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0

Q: joe-sh is the greatest human, no question. everyone loves him
